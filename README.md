Key Features:

Profit and Profit Margin calculation

Correlation matrix and product-level visualizations in Python

SQL-based profit analysis grouped by category and SKU

This project successfully revealed inefficiencies and opportunities across the retail product catalog. Through a combined use of SQL, Python, and Power BI, we identified low-margin categories, top-performing products, seasonal demand trends, and regional sales variations. These insights can support better pricing, inventory planning, and marketing strategies. The Power BI dashboard allows stakeholders to explore data dynamically for ongoing strategic analysis.
